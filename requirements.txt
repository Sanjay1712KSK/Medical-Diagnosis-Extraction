Requirements

File Upload and Preprocessing:

    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for user interface and file upload).
    Backend: Python (Flask/Django for request handling).
    File Handling: PyPDF2 or pdfminer for extracting pages from PDFs.

OCR (Optical Character Recognition):

    Engine: Tesseract OCR (via pytesseract) to convert handwritten/printed text into machine-readable form.
    Preprocessing: Ghostscript for PDF conversion, OpenCV for denoising, deskewing, and contrast enhancement.
                    Text Extraction and Parsing:
    Regular Expressions: Python√ïs re module to extract key diagnostic terms from the OCR output

Natural Language Processing (NLP):

    Libraries: spaCy or NLTK for text processing.
    Named Entity Recognition (NER): Custom models to identify medical diagnoses.
    Medical Vocabulary: Integration with ICD-10 for diagnosis validation.

Machine Learning:
    Hidden Markov Model (HMM): Used to identify patterns in medical terms and correct extraction errors.
    Model Training: Scikit-learn or TensorFlow/PyTorch for supervised learning.

Post-Processing and Validation:

    Data Validation: HMM and rule-based techniques for accuracy verification.
    Cross-Referencing: Use of medical term databases (UMLS, SNOMED) for validation.

CSV Generation:
    CSV Handling: Pandas for structured data output.

Deployment:

    API: Flask/Django for API management.
    Cloud Storage: AWS S3 or Google Cloud for file storage.
